From healthcare advancements to better communication tools, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre moving toward a future shaped by tech. However, as we rely more on these technologies, some argue we‚Äôre losing the very things that make us human. \n        Is technology bringing us closer together or pushing us further apart?

However, it can also connect people and help raise awareness of important causes. Some people argue that social media isn‚Äôt the problem ‚Äì it‚Äôs how we use it. What is the true impact? It depends on who you ask.\n        \"\"\"\n    \n    elif topic == \"The ethics of genetic engineering\":\n        essay = \"\"\"\n        Genetic engineering holds incredible promise, from curing diseases to creating more resilient crops.
