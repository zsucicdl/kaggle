Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we have seen\n- The features of the dataset describe games (hundreds of features) and players (four strategy elements per player).\n- The test dataset uses other games than the training dataset. To prepare our models for unseen games, we cross-validate them with a GroupKFold.\n- Only a third of the features seems to be useful. The other two thirds can be dropped.\n- The experiment with InterpretML's ExplainableBoostingRegressor shows that we can distinguish three groups of influences on the target variable:\n  1. The rules of the game can affect the target independently of the players, for instance if the rules of the game favor the first player against the second or if the game is prone to result in a draw.\n  2. The player strategies can affect the target independently of the game: MAST in general is the better playout strategy than NST.\n  3. The player strategies interact with the games: The ProgressiveHistory strategy seems to be particularly suitable for games with low PlayoutsPerSecond. In a game where the players cannot calculate arbitrarily many playouts without getting into a timeout, ProgressiveHistory has an advantage against the other strategies. These interactions between player strategy and game are what the competition is about.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparing the submission\n\nDon't submit this notebook — it is much too slow and would run into a timeout!\n\nWe save the models and the ensemble weights to disk so that we can load them in a separate notebook.
