Soemers and Cameron Browne\n\n\"Game-specific agents have been studied since the beginning of the AI field and are often used as benchmarks of well-known problems. For example, many single-player games, commonly called puzzles, are interesting illustrations of planning problems (e.g. Rubik’s Cube or Sokoban) or Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Similarly, multiplayer games are representations of many different AI research\nareas (Knowledge Representation, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning, etc.) which lead to the development of many game AI agents trying to outperform human players.\"\n\n\"The success of these dedicated game-playing programs has demonstrated their capacity to outperform humans, marking a milestone in artificial intelligence research. However, they are often highly reliant on game-specific knowledge and expertise, preventing them from playing other games as effectively.\nBuilding general game AI agents that perform well on any board game, rather than being specialised, is the aim of General Game Playing (GGP).\"\n\n\"These general game AI agents are implemented without knowing the games they will play in advance and consequently, they cannot use specific pre-defined knowledge about them when playing the game. This differs greatly from dedicated game AI agents, as the AIs developed for specific games are often biased by human-developed heuristics. Unfortunately, humans still tend to outperform AI in general board games. This can be explained by the human capacity for understanding common aspects between games\nand consequently being able to learn new games quicker by detecting common points with previously played games.\"\n\n\"This paper introduces board game concepts for GGP through the Ludii general game system. These concepts are expressed in game terms commonly used by game players and designers, making them an interesting mechanism for providing human-understandable explanations of different AI techniques. These concepts can be associated with several levels of abstraction, such as the game itself, a game trial, a game state, or individual moves. This opens many new possibilities for different AI research topics, including agent selection, transfer learning between games, AI explainability, as well as game generation, reconstruction, and recommendation.\"\n\n\n### General Game Playing (GGP)\n\n\"Many GGP systems describe their games using a standardised game description language. Different game descriptions are written in different formats and with different levels of abstraction, lending themselves to different kinds of knowledge representation, reasoning, and learning approaches (such\nas for performance reasons).\"\n\n\"The purpose of GDL (Game Description Language) is to provide a generic language for representing any board game. An extension named GDL-II has been developed to handle games with partial observations and stochastic actions, and another extension named GDL-III for epistemic games. This formalism and platform have provided a high-level challenge which has led to important research contributions,especially in Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhancements.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, GDL also has some negative points. This includes poor efficiency, the fact that each element of the game has to be defined tabula rasa and cannot easily be taken from previously modelled examples, and verbose game descriptions that are not representative of any game-related aspects that human players typically use.\"\n\nThe Regular Boardgames (RBG)\n\n\"RBG: The Regular Boardgames (RBG) system proposes the idea of encoding piece movement for games using\na regular language.\"\n\n### Ludii: The Ludii system\n\n\"Ludii: The Ludii system , named after its predecessor LUDI, is a complete general board game system, that can model games as a tree of ludemes. The decomposition of games into their conceptual units of game-related information ludemes results in more intuitive games descriptions compared to prior GGP systems. The number and variety of board games that are implemented within Ludii also go far beyond\nthose presented by most prior general game systems. Ludii is capable of modelling the full range of playable GDL games, as well as stacking games, boardless games, and games with hidden information. This, combined with high efficiency compared to other general systems, makes Ludii the ideal system for investigating the new game concepts-based research directions discussed in this paper.\"\n\n\"Ludii uses a class grammar approach to provide a direct link between the keywords in its game descriptions and the underlying Java code that implements them. The core of Ludii is a ludeme library, consisting of several classes, each implementing a specific ludeme. Ludemes are used to define both the form of the game (rules and equipment) and its function (legal moves and outcomes for the end state).\n\n The rules of the game can also be decomposed into four specific sub-sections:\n \n• Meta-rules applied to each state (e.g. no repetition).\n\n• Starting rules defining the initial state.\n\n• Playing rules defining the legal moves for a state s.\n\n• Ending rules defining the conditions under which the game’s outcome is determined.\n\n## GAME CONCEPTS\n\n\"Every game concept in Ludii is defined by its name, its category, its data type (numerical or binary) and its computation type. Each concept’s name is selected to be as close as possible to terms used by human players or game designers. Version 1.2.0 of Ludii, used in this paper, currently implements\n428 distinct game concepts. To organise these concepts, the authors proposed a **taxonomy** inspired by the Core Subject **Taxonomy for Mathematical Sciences Education** outlined by the Mathematical Association of America.\" \n\n### Concept Categories\n\nThe seven main Concept categories are:\n\n• Properties: Concepts related to the format of the game (time model, information type, symmetries, players,...).\n\n• Equipment: Concepts related to the board (shape, tiling, graph,...) and pieces (tile, dice, large piece,...).\n\n• Rules: Concepts related to each rule type (meta, start, play, end). \n\n• Math: Concepts relating to fields of Mathematics (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logic, Algorithmic,...).\n\n• Metrics: Concepts describing well-know game metrics (game length, branching factor,...).\n\n• Visual: Concepts describing a game’s graphical style.\n\n• Implementation: Concepts describing game implementation details.\n\n\"Thanks to this taxonomy, it is possible to focus only on a specific subset of categories depending on the specific application or research field. For example, many game-playing applications would have no use for the visual category, while explainable AI research will likely disregard the implementation category.\n\n### Data Type\n\n\"A game concept can be numerical or binary. Binary concepts are used to show the existence of concepts in games, while numerical concepts are used to quantify them. A binary game concept is activated if a specific ludeme, or a combination of ludemes, is used in the game’s description.\"\n\n### Computation\n\n\"Within the Ludii software, game concepts can be obtained in two different ways. One is done near-instantaneously during game compilation (compilation concepts), the other requires running playouts (playout concepts). This distinction is important depending on the intended application.\"\n\n\"Compilation concepts are based only on the ludemes used to describe static properties of the game, such as the dimensions of the game board. Each atomic action in Ludii can return the concepts triggered by their application to a game state, consequently, game concepts can be associated with each move played instantaneously, due to the atomic-action representation of a move.\"\n\n\"By running many playouts and consequently obtaining many trials for a single game, the values of the frequency game concepts can be computed by averaging the frequency of the concepts in each trial. Similarly, all the concepts belonging to the Metrics category, such as GAME LENGTH or BRANCHING FACTOR, are also computed using these playouts. For all playout concepts, it is important to note that their values are dependent on the playout type, which can be obtained randomly or with different game-playing agents.\"\n\n ### GGP RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n \nThe different possible applications and research directions that can utilise the different game concept categories their data types, as well as how they are computed:\n\nAgent Selection, Transfer Learning, Explainability, Move Evaluation, Game Generation, Game Reconstruction (Digital Ludeme Project - DLP), Game Recommender Systems.\n\n\"Future work over the next few years will primarily involve identifying more game concepts and implementing their detection within the Ludii system, as well as investigating the research directions proposed in this paper.\"\n\n### The Ludeme Philosophy \n\n\"In the long term, the ludeme philosophy used to represent games could be extended to other domains, such as protein folding, physics simulations or chemical reactions, by adapting the notion of ludemes to conceptual units of each of these topics.\"\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01078\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hi, since train/test have 814 columns I won't even bother to open them.
