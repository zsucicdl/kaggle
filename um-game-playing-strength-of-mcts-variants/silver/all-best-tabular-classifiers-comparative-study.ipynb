Introduction - Motivation and Game Rules</h1>\n</div>\n\n[Back to table of contents](#TOC)\n\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #ffcccc; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ff3333; border-radius: 5px;\">\n           <strong>Remark:</strong> if you are runing this notebook for the first time and getting errors, think about checking the library versions compatibility! Some updates sometimes make older codes crash. You can force a given version to be installed with <code>!pip uninstall the_library -y</code>, then <code>!pip install the_library==1.1.1</code> if you want e.g. to install version 1.1.1. The versions I use are listed in section 2.\n</div>\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are all using ensemble methods for tabular classification. Usually, `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn is the perfect tool you need: it is easy to use, needs very few data preprocessing and generally reaches outstanding performances without needing hyperparameter tuning. However, scikit-learn doesn't have the monopole of tabular classification. In the [machine learning intermediate tutorial on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) for instance, [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is designed as \"*the most accurate modeling technique for structured data.*\".\n\nNevertheless, from my personal experience and the fellow AI students I met, XGBoost didn't reach expected performances. Is `XGBoostClassifier` harder to use than its scikit-learn's fellow? Maybe. Does it work in more specific contexts, that do not correspond to the use cases my mates worked on? Maybe. The purpose of this study is to **give a general overview of those classifier's performances and best use case**, so that you have some experimental knowledge about those models. The goal is to help you deciding which classifier to pick up for your specific use case, and a few tips to use them correctly (though I do not intend to make an in-depth analysis of the libraries insights, there already exists several interesting notebooks on Kaggle about that).\n\n## Classifiers\n\nI will compare the following classifiers over very similar tests. You will find below a table of the used classifiers and their corresponding preprocessing needs:\n\n| Model          | Can Skip Normalization | Can Skip Scaling | Can Skip Missing Value Handling | Can Skip Categorical Value Handling |\n|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Random Forest from Sklearn  | Yes                    | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| Gradient Boosting from Sklearn| Yes                  | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| Histogram Gradient Boosting from Sklearn| Yes                  | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| Bagging Classifier from Sklearn| Yes                  | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| XGBoost        | Yes                    | Yes              | Yes                           | No                                 |\n| LightGBM       | Yes                    | Yes              | Yes                           | Yes (with native support)          |\n| CatBoost       | Yes                    | Yes              | Yes                           | Yes (handles categorical directly) |\n| AdaBoost from Sklearn       | Yes                    | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| ExtraTrees from Sklearn     | Yes                    | Yes              | No                            | No                                 |\n| Sequential from Keras | No         | No               | No                            | No                                 |\n\nOf note, GPU acceleration will **not** be used through this notebook, to guarantee a good balance into computational ressources used.\n\n## Datasets\n\nI choose 3 datasets (so far) among the most popular ones in Kaggle, that are all very different from each other, plus 3 other that I added later (v1.1) for diffent reasons. Those are the [credit card fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) (imbalanced binary classification), the [Netflix TV shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) (multi-label classification), the [chest Xray pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) (image classification, because it is still interesting to see how tabular models work on images), the space Titanic, the MNIST and the ICR datasets.\n\nRegarding the pneumonia dataset, I will extract some features from the image itself using the library I developped: `fast-skimage`. CatBoost classification has proved to be very efficient in my [previous study about brain cancer classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrelemercier/99-8-accuracy-on-brain-tumor-classification), so I think it is worth the shot trying it again. Tabular classifiers are much faster than Keras ones, and we could hence spare lots of intense training resources.\n\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #ffcccc; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ff3333; border-radius: 5px;\">\n           <strong>Remark:</strong> you are looking at version 1.3 of this study. Other datasets might be added in later versions.\n</div>\n\n## Experimental Tests\n\nThe following experimental tests will be conducted to compare those classifiers:\n\n1. Accuracy and F1-score computing with minimum possible preprocessing and no parameter tuning. This will give an insight about **training time** and **ease of use** (because we don't only want to optimize computational resources, but also time we spend developping models);\n2. The same after an Optuna hyperparameter optimization (I am not a big fan of grid search). This will give an insight about **performance**. Note that the ease of use score can be derived from the difference between initial performance and optimized performance.\n3. Same models, but training on a very small portion of each dataset. A good model should extract patterns from as few data as possible. This will give an insight about **data dependance**.\n4. Finally, conduct [evasion attacks](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=atlas-evasion-attack) on the best models using the [Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox). This will give an insight on **adversarial robustness**.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe conclusions of this study are drawn from pure empirical analyses over a limited number of publicly available datasets. At version 1.0, there were only 3 of them. The confidence into my results is limited by the small number of datasets, and my limited experience about each library. **Feel free to improve this study by suggesting new implementation techniques or/and new datasets.**\n\nAlso, I will use ChatGPT 4o for several tasks. I believe it is an incredible tool that can make us all win a lot of time. Some will disagree, but I don't see any problem in using it for machine learning projects, and even strongly encourage collegues to do so.\n\n## Previous Work\n\nThis work is inspired from my first experiments on linear models (cf. [The Regularization Rumble](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrelemercier/mlmfo-episode-1-the-regularization-rumble)). This is my most successfull notebook on Kaggle (at the time I am writing those lines), but I was much less experimented as I am now. I hope this study will be more usefull that the previous one.\n\nAs mentionned before, the methods used on image classification derives from my [brain tumor study](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrelemercier/99-8-accuracy-on-brain-tumor-classification). I am particularly proud of this work, which was very well received by my image processing teacher and allowed me to obtain an internship at Sony R&D.\n\nFinally, I discovered that autoencoders (AE) could reach high performance in anomaly detection during my work on [Quantized Autoencoders (QAE)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrelemercier/quantized-autoencoder-qae-ids-for-iot-devices) where I built the extensive QAE class to detect cyberattacks. This is also a notebook I am proud of.\n\n## Updates Log\n\n- 1.0: Initial study\n- 1.1: Add 3 datasets (ICR, MNIST, Spaceship Titanic) and more conclusion plots\n- 1.2: Add Keras' Sequential Model for all datasets and CIC dataset\n- 1.3: Apply second experiment (Optuna optimization) for the 5 datasets that do not lead to near-perfect classification\n\nYou are currently looking at version **1.3** of this study.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"s1\"></a>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #E6E6FA; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid purple; border-radius: 5px;\">  \n    <h1>2.

Catboost will have a specially dedicated pipeline using the Pool object. We will create `df_credit`, `df_netflix` along with `X_train_credit`, etc. knowing that the label for credit card fraud is \"Class\" and the one for Netflix is \"duration\". For Netflix, we need to drop every row which \"duration\" is not in the form \"X Seasons\" or \"1 Season\". The labels will be the number of seasons, so we will just encode \"1\", \"2\", etc. in a new column \"Class\". Of course, we need to drop the previous \"duration\" column.\n\nThe Netflix dataset needs in-depth preprocessing, because most of features are categorical:\n- \"show_id\": to drop\n- \"type\": OHE encoding because few labels (2)\n- \"title\": extract the number of words in the title, then drop the title\n- \"director\": lots of null values, sometimes several directors, lots of different directors... keep for Pool's Catboost but drop for the others\n- \"cast\": extract actors in a list with \", \" separator, detect the 20 most cited actors, OHE encoding for them. There are null values here too. In this case, put \"0\" everywhere for OHE\n- \"country\": 5017 different values. OHE over the 20 most cited, \"other\" for the others.\n- \"date_added\": extract the month (the content before the space character) and OHE other the 12 months\n- \"realease_year\": the only numerical feature\n- \"rating\": 3k+ different values, OHE for the 20 most common\n- \"listed_in\": 8k+ different values, do the same as for the actors (OHE over most cited categories)\n- \"description\": drop\n\nWe also make some categorical preprocessing for the Spaceship Titanic.\n\nOf note, the columns from which OHE was extracted should be dropped.
