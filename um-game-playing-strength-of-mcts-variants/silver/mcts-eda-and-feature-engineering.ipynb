It has gained prominence due to its effectiveness in a wide range of games, from Go to general board games. MCTS operates by simulating random playouts of potential game states and expanding the most promising branches of a game tree, balancing exploration of new strategies with the exploitation of known successful paths. However, MCTS comes in various variants, each tailored to specific types of games or problem spaces.\n\nThis project seeks to predict the relative performance of different MCTS variants in various board games. The competition goal is to analyze how MCTS configurations affect outcomes and understand which variants are most suitable for different game environments. We aim to build a model that accurately predicts the game outcomes based on a set of features describing the games and the specific MCTS agent configurations.\n\n**Key Concepts in General Game Playing**\n\nIn the broader context of artificial intelligence research, general game-playing (GGP) refers to the development of AI agents that can play a variety of games without being specialized for any particular game. Unlike traditional AI models that are designed to master specific games (such as AlphaGo for Go), general game-playing agents aim to be adaptable across different game types without pre-existing knowledge. This project focuses on evaluating MCTS variants within such a general game-playing framework.\n\nGeneral Game Playing agents are designed to function without knowing the games they will play in advance. This contrasts with game-specific AI agents, which often use heuristics and human-designed strategies to excel in specific environments. GGP agents must instead rely on learning and exploration, making the performance of MCTS variants highly relevant to the success of these agents.\n\n\n**MCTS variants can differ across several dimensions, including:**\n\n* Selection Strategy: How the agent selects which game state to explore next. Popular strategies include Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1), Progressive History, and more.\n* Exploration Constant: A parameter controlling the balance between exploring new strategies and exploiting known ones.\n* Playout Policy: How the agent simulates the outcome of a game from a given state, which can range from random playouts to more sophisticated heuristics like Move-Average Sampling Techniques (MAST).\n* Score Bounds: Some variants also use score bounds to limit or normalize the evaluation of game states.\n\nEach of these aspects can have a significant impact on the agent's ability to perform in different game environments. The competition dataset includes various combinations of these features, and our task is to learn which configurations lead to the best performance under different game scenarios.\n\n\n**Objective of the Project**\n\nOur objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the performance (game outcomes) of MCTS variants in general board games. To achieve this, we will analyze the dataset provided by the competition, which includes various game features and agent configurations. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns that reveal how certain MCTS variants excel in specific game types.\n\n**Research Significance**\n\nUnderstanding the performance of MCTS variants in different contexts is crucial for advancing AI in general game playing. This project has implications for:\n* Agent Selection: Choosing the most effective agent for a given game environment.\n* Transfer Learning: Applying knowledge gained from one game to another, based on similarities in game structure.\n* AI Explainability: Providing insights into why certain variants perform better, which can help design more transparent and interpretable AI systems.\n* Generalization: Developing AI models that are not restricted by domain-specific knowledge and can excel across a broad range of games.\n\n\n**Approach**\n\nWe will employ machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Regressors to model the relationship between game features and outcomes. By preprocessing the data to handle categorical variables (e.g., agent descriptions), applying techniques such as feature encoding and model evaluation, we aim to produce a predictive model that operates efficiently within the competition constraints. The dataset includes hundreds of features describing game rules, agents, and configurations, making feature selection and efficient model training critical.\n\nWhy Random Forest? This model is robust for handling a mix of categorical and numerical features. It doesn’t require heavy scaling of data and can model complex relationships, making it a good choice for this multi-dimensional data. Since we are predicting a continuous value (degree of advantage), Random Forest’s regression capabilities can help in modeling non-linear interactions between different features.\n\n**Preprocessing Pipeline:**\n\n* **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values in the dataset must be imputed. We use SimpleImputer to fill in missing values (mean/mode imputation), which is common for numerical and categorical data.\n* **Encoding Categorical Features**: Since the MCTS agent description has various categorical components, we break them down (like selection, exploration_const, etc.). These features are encoded using Ordinal Encoding to convert them into numerical values so that they can be fed into machine learning algorithms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1: Load the data\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Path to the dataset\ntrain_path = '/kaggle/input/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants/train.csv'\n\n# Load the data using Pandas\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 2: Check the structure of the dataset\n\nprint(\"First few rows of the dataset:\")\nprint(train_df.head())\n\n# Check column names and data types\nprint(\"\\nColumn names and data types:\")\nprint(train_df.dtypes)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-08T07:59:21.255425Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-08T07:59:21.255883Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-08T07:59:21.29151Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-08T07:59:21.255838Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-08T07:59:21.290222Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 3: Check for missing values\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking for missing values:\")\nprint(train_df.isnull().sum())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-08T07:59:37.486309Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-08T07:59:37.486782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-08T07:59:38.748754Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-08T07:59:37.486737Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-08T07:59:38.744996Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 4: Summary statistics of numeric columns\n\nprint(\"\\nSummary of numeric columns:\")\nprint(train_df.describe())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-08T07:59:40.406986Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-08T07:59:40.408088Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-08T07:59:46.931153Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-08T07:59:40.407926Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-08T07:59:46.929868Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 5: Unique values in categorical columns\n\n# Identify the object (string) columns for further processing\nstring_cols = train_df.select_dtypes(include=['object'])\n\nprint(\"\\nUnique values in categorical columns:\")\nfor col in string_cols.columns:\n    print(f\"Unique values in {col}: {train_df[col].nunique()}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-08T08:00:01.376766Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-08T08:00:01.377333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-08T08:00:02.628824Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-08T08:00:01.377284Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-08T08:00:02.62702Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\n\n# Load the dataset\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants/train.csv')\n\ndef split_agent_description(df, column_name):\n    #
