However, MCTS comes in various variants, each tailored to specific types of games or problem spaces.\n\nHere are some good resources for further study of MCTS:\n1. [A Survey of Monte-Carlo Techniques in Games](https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Rajkumar_1.pdf) \n2. [Monte Carlo Tree Search: A Review of Recent Modifications and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04931)\n\n## The Data\n\nHere is the description of some prominent columns in train.csv as described in the official overview:\n* **GameRulesetName** - (string) A combination of the game name and ruleset name in Ludii. Within the Ludii system, there is a distinction between games (cultural artifacts) and rulesets (the same game might be played according to different rulesets). **For the purposes of this competition, think of every unique combination of a game + a ruleset as a separate game**, although some games (ones that have many different rulesets) might be considered overrepresented in the training data.\n\n* **EnglishRules** - (string) An natural language (English) description of the rules of the game. This description is not guaranteed to be self-contained (e.g., it might refer to rules from famous other games, such as Chess, for brevity), unambiguous, or perfectly complete.\n\n* **LudRules** - (string) The description of the game in Ludii's game description language. This is the description that was used to compile the game inside Ludii and run the simulations, so it is always guaranteed to be 100% complete and unambiguous. However, this is a formal language that most existing Large Language Models / foundation models have likely received little, if any, exposure to.\n\n* **utility_agent1** - (float) The **target** column. The utility value that the first agent received, aggregated over all simulations we ran for this specific pair of agents in this game. This value will be between -1 (if the first agent lost every single game) and 1 (if the first agent won every single game). Utility is calculated as (n_games_won - n_games_lost) / n_games\n\n**test.csv** - The same as train.csv minus the following columns: num_wins_agent1, num_draws_agent1, num_losses_agent1, and utility_agent1 columns. Expect approximately 60,000 rows in the hidden test set.\n\n**concepts.csv** - A file, exported from the publicly available Ludii database, containing information on the Concept-based features of games.\n\n**Objective**: This competition challenges you to develop a model that can predict the performance of one MCTS variant against another in a given game, based on the features of the game.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What's Ludii\nLudii is a general game system designed to play, evaluate and design a wide range of games, including board games, card games, dice games, mathematical games, and so on. Games are described as structured sets of ludemes (units of game-related information). This allows the full range of traditional strategy games from around the world to be modelled in a single playable database.\n\nAs a simple example, the following code shows the full game description for Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n`(game \"Tic-Tac-Toe\"\n   (players 2)\n   (equipment\n      {\n         (board (square 3))\n         (piece \"Disc\" P1)\n         (piece \"Cross\" P2)\n      }\n   )\n   (rules\n      (play (move Add (to (sites Empty))))\n      (end (if (is Line 3) (result Mover Win)))\n   )\n)`\n\n\nHere are some useful resources to further understand Ludii concepts:\n* [Ludii Official Website](https://ludii.games/index.php)\n* [Ludii Tutorials](https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n* [Ludeme Tree visualization](https://ludii.games/ludemeTree.php)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Regarding the Polars Library\nAs the polars library (recommended here) might be less known to beginners as compared to Pandas, here is a brief introduction for those not much familiar with the Polars library :\n\n* It provides features to read, transform & manipulate tabular data just like Pandas\n* The API is very similar to Pandas & other common data wrangling libraries\n* It is optimized for parallel execution on modern hardware & can achieve substantial performance gains compared to pandas in many operations\n* Here is a chart showing performance comparison with other similar frameworks on the TPC-H benchmark\n\n![](https://pola.rs/_astro/perf-illustration.jHjw6PiD_165TDG.svg)\n\n\n### Basic useful functions from Polars library\n* polars.DataFrame() : Create a Polars dataframe from Python Dictionary or Lists\n* read_csv() & write_csv() : Read & write csv data.\n* describe() : Summary statistics for a DataFrame.\n* head() : Get the first n rows.\n* clone() : Create a copy of this DataFrame\n* count() : Return the number of non-null elements for each column.\n* drop() : Remove columns from the dataframe.\n* fill_null() : Fill null values using the specified value or strategy.\n* filter() : Filter the rows in the DataFrame based on one or more predicate expressions.\n* get_column() : Get a single column by name\n* group_by() : Start a group by operation.\n* select() : Select columns from this DataFrame.\n* sql() : Execute a SQL query against the DataFrame.\n* to_pandas() : Convert this DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame.\n\nFurther API Reference: https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/index.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# EDA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport os\nimport polars as pl\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\nimport lightgbm as lgbm\nimport kaggle_evaluation.mcts_inference_server\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom catboost import CatBoostRegressor\nimport warnings","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-27T16:12:57.754001Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-27T16:12:57.754574Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-27T16:13:01.407626Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-27T16:12:57.75451Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-27T16:13:01.406644Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the data\ntrain = pl.read_csv('/kaggle/input/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants/train.csv')\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-27T16:13:01.409421Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-27T16:13:01.409983Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-27T16:13:10.678278Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-27T16:13:01.409942Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-27T16:13:10.677112Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-27T16:13:10.679761Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-27T16:13:10.680201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-27T16:13:12.748701Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-27T16:13:10.68016Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-27T16:13:12.747593Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some Observations:\n* The train data has around 233k rows & more than 800 feature columns\n* Some columns seem to have a constant value across all rows as evident by same min & max values.
