They may contribute to poor mental status and perhaps contribute to neuronal injury. The four most mentioned are Generalized Rhythmic Delta Activity (GRDA), Lateralized Rhythmic Delta Activity (LRDA), Generalized Periodic Discharges (GPDs), and Lateralized Periodic Discharges (LPDs). There are others.\"\n\n\"Generalized Rhythmic Delta (GRDA):\n\n\"A non-specific pattern that is slow (<5 hz) and may be seen in profound encephalopathy, post-ictally or with inflammatory, degenerative, traumatic, or toxic-metabolic disorders.\"\n\nLateralized Rhythmic Delta (LRDA):\n\n\"Another lateralized slow (<5hz) pattern that usually reflects the presence of a focal lesion; associated with risk of acute seizures, especially non-convulsive status epilepticus.\"\n\nGeneralized Periodic Discharges (GPDs):\n\n\"Sharp waves or spikes that occur rhythmically in the right and left brain.  They may occur infrequently (0.5hz) or quite frequently (2hz). Tend to be seen in diffuse processes: toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, sepsis.  But may also be seen in herpes simplex virus encephalitis and autoimmune encephalopathies. Can be associated with NCSE.\"\n\nLateralized Periodic Discharges (LPDs):\n\n\"Lateralized sharp waves or spikes which made have associated slow waves.  Also can be seen infrequently or frequently (2hz).  Commonly encountered in stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, tumors, abscesses, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, herpes simplex virus and other infectious/autoimmune pathology.  LPDs are highly associated with seizures, especially in the setting of acute illness, metabolic disturbances or focal lesions.\"\n\nCitation: NeuroEMCrit Team (Casey & Neha).
