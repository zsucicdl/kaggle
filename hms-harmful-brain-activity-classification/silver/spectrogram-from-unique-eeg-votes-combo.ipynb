Rather than slicing the array for the middle 10,000 data points of the EEG, I slice using the offset (eeg_label_offset_seconds). For this reason, the spectrograms will be stored by label_id rather than eeg_id so each sample has a unique EEG spectrogram. To reduce the number of EEG spectrograms, I drop duplicate eeg_id paired with vote distributions to reduce the sample size to 20,183. That's 3,094 more samples than the original notebook, each with a slight variation in vote distribution.\n\n[0]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/how-to-make-spectrogram-from-eeg","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00726,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:41.9057","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:41.89844","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd, numpy as np, os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt, gc\n\nSAVE_INDIVIDUAL_EEGS = False\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/train.csv')\nprint('Train shape', train.shape )\ndisplay( train.head() )","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","papermill":{"duration":0.693827,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.606147","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:41.91232","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-14T03:14:34.095985Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-14T03:14:34.096675Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-14T03:14:34.627691Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-14T03:14:34.096639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-14T03:14:34.62677Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Drop duplicates when eeg_id and all 6 votes are the same.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_uniq = train.drop_duplicates(\n    subset=['eeg_id', 'seizure_vote', 'lpd_vote', 'gpd_vote', 'lrda_vote', 'grda_vote', 'other_vote'])\nprint('Train shape', df_uniq.shape )\n\ndf_uniq.head(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-14T03:46:09.035373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-14T03:46:09.035762Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-14T03:46:09.064252Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-14T03:46:09.035732Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-14T03:46:09.063257Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Bipolar Double Banana Montage\nIn the Kaggle discussion [here][1], we learn what information we need to make spectrograms from eegs. The following website [here][2] is helpful also. To build 1 spectrogram, we need 1 time series signal. Kaggle provides us with 19 eeg time signals, so we must combine them into 4 time signals to make 4 spectrograms.\n\nIn the diagram below, we see which electrode signals are needed to make the `LL, LP, RP, RR` spectrograms. Furthermore Kaggle discussions imply that most likely we create differences between consecutive electrodes and average the differences. For example, we create `LL spectrogram` with the formula: \n\n    LL = ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4.\n    \nI am not positive that this is the correct formula. I also tried the formula below but it produced a worse CV score than the above formula, so perhaps the above is correct. I am confident that we only use these 5 electrodes to create `LL spectrogram`. I'm just a little unsure about the formula:\n\n    LL = ( Fp1 + F7 + T3 + T5 + O1 )/5.\n    \n# Exciting UPDATE!\nI believe the above two formulas are wrong. Many Kagglers have pointed out that the above formula reduces to `LL = ( Fp1 - O1 )/4` which means that it does not use all the EEG signals. The new formula below utilizes all the EEG signals and produces EEG spectrograms that achieve better CV score and LB score than the Kaggle spectrograms. Therefore I think the following formula is the correct one:\n\n    LL Spec = ( spec(Fp1 - F7) + spec(F7 - T3) + spec(T3 - T5) + spec(T5 - O1) )/4.\n    \nSince creating a spectrogram is a non-linear operation, the above formula which computes 4 spectrograms and then takes the average is different than the formula below which computes 1 spectrogam. And the above formula does utilize all EEG signals and cannot be reduced to a shorter formula (like the one below).\n\n    LL Spec = spec( ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4. )\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Jan-2024/montage.png)\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/discussion/467877\n[2]: https://www.learningeeg.com/montages-and-technical-components","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007102,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.620233","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.613131","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"NAMES = ['LL','LP','RP','RR']\n\nFEATS = [['Fp1','F7','T3','T5','O1'],\n         ['Fp1','F3','C3','P3','O1'],\n         ['Fp2','F8','T4','T6','O2'],\n         ['Fp2','F4','C4','P4','O2']]","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017131,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.644893","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.627762","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-14T03:48:37.909952Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-14T03:48:37.910281Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-14T03:48:37.916253Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-14T03:48:37.910254Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-14T03:48:37.915315Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Optional Signal Denoising with Wavelet transform\nWe can optionally denoise the signal before creating the spectrogram.
