For a reminder, the goal of this competition is to detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity. From electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from critically ill hospital patients, we must build a classifier that is able to assign for a given EEG time series the correct class based on the detection and recognition of one of 6 patterns:\n* seizure (SZ)\n* generalized periodic discharges (GPD)\n* lateralized periodic discharges (LPD)\n* lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA)\n* generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA)\n* ‚Äúother‚Äù for all signals that do not fit inside above categories\n\nAll patterns have specific characteristics based on their frequency, the existence of time gap between pulse, their temporal extent and their location.

Explanations are mainly based on competition data description\navailable at [HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/data):\n* `eeg_id`: A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording. Those identifies also the parquet files of the eeg in the **train_eegs** folder. Note that as each row denominates a particular subsample of an EEG, there can be several rows with same eeg_id.\n* `eeg_sub_id`: An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to. `eeg_sub_id` are assigned in chronological order for each `eeg_id` beginning with 0. The subsample is shifted from the beginning of the `eeg_id` record by `eeg_label_offset_seconds`. Note that even if subsample is 50 seconds long, the annotation is done by looking at the central 10 seconds.\n* `eeg_label_offset_seconds`: The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample. Time shift.\n* `spectrogram_id`: A unique identifier for an entire spectrogram. A spectrogram can regroup several EEGs records. Note that `spectrogram_id` are name of spectrogram files in folder **train_spectrograms**. For more information on what is a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram).\n* `spectrogram_sub_id`: An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to. Same concept as for `eeg_sub_id`.\n* `spectogram_label_offset_seconds`: The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample. Simple time shift.\n* `label_id`: An ID for this set of labels. Unique for each row.\n* `patient_id`: An ID for the patient who donated the data. An `eeg_id` or `spectrogram_id` is associated with a single `patient_id` but a single patient can be associated with several eegs and spectrograms.\n* `expert_consensus`: The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only. Give the final decision for classifying of the 10 seconds central window of a given subsample in one of the 6 available category.\n* `[seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote`: The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: lpd: lateralized periodic discharges, gpd: generalized periodic discharges, lrd: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and grda: generalized rhythmic delta activity. Note that total number of annotators can vary for each row, even within the same eeg.

It is a transformation that associate to a function defined in the temporal domain a function defined in the frequency domaine.

So to make it brief, we can consider our input EKG signal made up of different frequency components (for exemple a 1Hz component for heartbeats rate at 60/min) and the Fourier transform will allow us to decompose the EKG signal into those different frequency components and for each of those components we will have amplitude and phase. For more information about the Fourier transform, you can check out the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform).\n\nAs we have discrete signals, we will have to compute a [discrete Fourier transform (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform), and for that we can make use of [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), which is an efficient algorithm for computing DFT.\n\nScipy offers us a module [fft](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fft.html#module-scipy.fft) for Fourier analysis. We will rely upon it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y_ekg = fft.fft(ekg_subsample)\n\n# array of frequencies corresponding to the FT points\n# determined by number of points and sampling interval (inverse of sampling frequency)\nfd = fft.fftfreq(n=len(y_ekg), d=1 / fs)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.433908Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.434294Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.445266Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.434262Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.444019Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# to plot the amplitude of each frequency, we take the absolute value of the complex number\n# also as the FT is symmetric between (-fs/2, fs/2), we only plot the first half\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(fd[:len(fd) // 2], np.abs(y_ekg)[:len(fd) // 2])\nplt.grid()\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Amplitude\")\nplt.title(\"EKG spectrum\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.82529Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.825706Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-12T00:27:49.130117Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-12T00:27:48.825674Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-12T00:27:49.129006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ok so we have some good information here. So we can see that we have the amplitude of the frequency components from 0 Hz to 100 Hz. This value of 100 Hz is quite important, it is related to the [Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) which states that a continuous signal $x(t)$ which does not contain frequency component higher than $B\\; Hz$ can be fully reconstructed by a discrete sampling $\\{x(n \\times \\frac{1}{fs})\\}_n$ if the sampling frequency $f_s$ is at least two times the higher $x(t)$ frequency: $f_s > 2B$.\n\nOur original `EKG` signal is sampled at 200 Hz. So the highest frequency we can have reliable information on is: $200/2 = 100 \\;Hz$\n\nWe observe two major amplitude peaks:\n* one at 0 Hz: it is the \"non-oscillating\" component, the mean component. As we are measuring potential in volt (V), the measure is equivalent up to a constant. So we can subtract mean from the signal for convenience.\n* one huge at approximately 60 Hz: it is likely to be due to powerline interference (50 Hz or 60 Hz).
