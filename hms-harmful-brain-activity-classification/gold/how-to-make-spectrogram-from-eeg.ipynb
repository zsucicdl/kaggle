The EEGs are waveforms and the Spectrograms are images. There is a discussion about this notebook [here][1].\n\nIn version 1-3, we also train a simple model using our EEG spectrograms to confirm that they work well. We observe that a model trained with EEG spectrograms performs better than baseline models using only train means.\n\n# Exciting UPDATE!\nVersion 4 of this notebook uses a different formula to make spectrograms than earlier versions. I trained an EfficientNet model using the old version eeg spectrograms, new version spectrograms, and Kaggle spectrograms. We can see that the new version eeg spectrograms are **powerful**!\n\n| Spectrogram | 5-Fold CV | LB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kaggle spectrogram | 0.73 | 0.57 |\n| Old EEG formula | 0.84 on fold 1 | ?? |\n| New EEG formula | 0.70 on fold 1| ?? |\n| Use both Kaggle and New | 0.64 | 0.44 |\n\nFrom the results above, we conclude that our new formula is probably similar or better than the true formula used to create the Kaggle spectrograms. Details about the old and new formula are in the next notebook section. \n\n# How To Use EEG Spectrograms\nExamples of how to use new EEG spectrograms to boost CV score and LB score will be (or already are) published in recent versions of my EfficientNet starter notebook [here][2] and CatBoost starter notebook [here][3]\n\n# Kaggle Dataset\nThe new EEG spectrograms from version 4 of this notebook have been uploaded to a Kaggle dataset [here][4].

The following website [here][2] is helpful also. To build 1 spectrogram, we need 1 time series signal. Kaggle provides us with 19 eeg time signals, so we must combine them into 4 time signals to make 4 spectrograms.\n\nIn the diagram below, we see which electrode signals are needed to make the `LL, LP, RP, RR` spectrograms. Furthermore Kaggle discussions imply that most likely we create differences between consecutive electrodes and average the differences. For example, we create `LL spectrogram` with the formula: \n\n    LL = ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4.\n    \nI am not positive that this is the correct formula. I also tried the formula below but it produced a worse CV score than the above formula, so perhaps the above is correct. I am confident that we only use these 5 electrodes to create `LL spectrogram`. I'm just a little unsure about the formula:\n\n    LL = ( Fp1 + F7 + T3 + T5 + O1 )/5.\n    \n# Exciting UPDATE!\nI believe the above two formulas are wrong. Many Kagglers have pointed out that the above formula reduces to `LL = ( Fp1 - O1 )/4` which means that it does not use all the EEG signals. The new formula below utilizes all the EEG signals and produces EEG spectrograms that achieve better CV score and LB score than the Kaggle spectrograms. Therefore I think the following formula is the correct one:\n\n    LL Spec = ( spec(Fp1 - F7) + spec(F7 - T3) + spec(T3 - T5) + spec(T5 - O1) )/4.\n    \nSince creating a spectrogram is a non-linear operation, the above formula which computes 4 spectrograms and then takes the average is different than the formula below which computes 1 spectrogam. And the above formula does utilize all EEG signals and cannot be reduced to a shorter formula (like the one below).\n\n    LL Spec = spec( ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4. )\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Jan-2024/montage.png)\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/discussion/467877\n[2]: https://www.learningeeg.com/montages-and-technical-components","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007102,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.620233","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.613131","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"NAMES = ['LL','LP','RP','RR']\n\nFEATS = [['Fp1','F7','T3','T5','O1'],\n         ['Fp1','F3','C3','P3','O1'],\n         ['Fp2','F8','T4','T6','O2'],\n         ['Fp2','F4','C4','P4','O2']]\n\ndirectory_path = 'EEG_Spectrograms/'\nif not os.path.exists(directory_path):\n    os.makedirs(directory_path)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017131,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.644893","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.627762","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-21T13:08:37.362456Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-21T13:08:37.363545Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-21T13:08:37.372414Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-21T13:08:37.363488Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-21T13:08:37.371183Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Optional Signal Denoising with Wavelet transform\nWe can optionally denoise the signal before creating the spectrogram.
