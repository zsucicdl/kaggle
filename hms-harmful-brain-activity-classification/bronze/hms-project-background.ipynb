The weak electrical current that these groups of neurons produce is massively amplified, resulting in an EEG recording.\n\nThe waves that we see in an EEG recording are sinusoidal in nature, and they are normally measured from peak to trough. There are four main classifications for EEG brain wave patterns: \n\n1. Beta waves - more than 13Hz\n2. Alpha waves - 8-13Hz\n3. Theta waves - 4-8Hz\n4. Delta waves - 0.5-4Hz\n\nDepending on the state of the subject one waveform will be more dominant thatn the rest (ex: beta waves dominate during wakefulness, delta waves dominate during non-REM deep sleep). \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## EEG Patterns\n\nFor any of these patterns to be a bona fide pattern, they need to occur at least 6 times one after another.\n\n### Periodic \nPeriodic discharges with intervals between them\n\n### Rhythmic \nDischarges with no breaks\n\n### Spike and Wave (rare)\nTight spikes and a longer wave afterwards, with no intervals\n\n## Harmful brain patterns \n\n### Seizure characteristics\n*See ref 3*\n\nGeneral Absence Seizures show a cortical-wide change in brain wave amplitude to ~3Hz continuously for a period until the seizure ends.\n\n### Generalized Periodic Discharges (GPD)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References\n\n1.
