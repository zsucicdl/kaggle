git clone https://github.com/Ynakatsuka/kaggle_scripts
cd kaggle_scripts
pip install .


actually read the code notes

insight based files: feature groups, models
optimize on those files for hyperparameters
save best model configs
final train those models
ensemble those models in another notebook, or on kaggle?
publish models on kaggle
publish single (with some parameters) or ensembled kernels of those models


fine tuned tokenizer

group cfg

tokenized_valid.features etc

more detailed refactoring

concept of copying on selection?

typing

ryzen 512 anx etc

ehy is cdeotte averaging predictions
